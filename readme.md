## Status of this Repository on GitHub

The master branch is the current state of the (previously called) “i6” branch from which the 5.1 releases have been drawn. 

This branch currently contains updates ahead of the 5.1.1-beta release and we plan to maintain this GitHub repo ahead of public releases.

We are planing to transition the development branches to GitHub also but haven't decided on a branching model and workflow yet.

## Usage info
