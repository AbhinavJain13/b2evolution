## More than a blogâ€‰!

Why restrain yourself to a single blog when your website could be so much more?

b2evolution includes everything you need. Right out of the box. Plugins optional.

## This is the i6 (b2evolution v5) Branch !

We maintain this GitHub repo ahead of public releases.

Note we have moved the previous "master" branch to "old-master".

This 'i6' branch includes an import on the CVS history from SoureForge as well as a sync to the latest 5.x version from the "i6" branch on our developement SVN repository.

Please switch to the "master" branch for the latest codebase available.
